#How's It Going!

Hi! I'm Charles and I'm starting out with my journey to programming. I'm still learning a lot of web development, however, I came to currently focus on my back-end abilities. I hope throughout this course I can learn more about django and use it to aid the databases in the future websites that I will create.
